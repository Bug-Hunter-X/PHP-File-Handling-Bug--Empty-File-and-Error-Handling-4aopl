```php
$file = fopen("path/to/file.txt", "r");
if ($file) {
    // Process the file
    fclose($file);
} else {
    // Handle the error
}
```
This code has a potential bug. If `fopen()` fails, the `$file` variable will be `false`.  However, if the file is empty (but exists), the `fopen()` call will succeed, but `feof($file)` will immediately return `true` which can lead to premature termination of the file processing loop.

Another issue is the error handling. It only states that an error occurred but doesn't explain why.
